# Rock Paper Scissors Recognition

!Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a web application that can recognize the shape of rock, paper, or scissors from the image uploaded by the user. This project uses the following technologies:

- Deep learning model trained with the Rock Paper Scissors dataset from Kaggle.
- Flask as the web framework and PIL as the library for image processing.
- OCI as the cloud provider and Docker as the tool for deploying the application.
- GitHub Actions as the tool for creating a CI/CD pipeline that builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.

## Workflow

The workflow of this project is as follows:

1. The user uploads an image that contains the shape of rock, paper, or scissors to the web application.
2. The web application sends the image to the deep learning model that runs on the OCI server.
3. The deep learning model recognizes the shape of rock, paper, or scissors from the image and sends the result to the web application.
4. The web application displays the prediction result to the user.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in creating a web application based on deep learning and using cloud and Docker technologies. This project also shows my creativity and innovation in developing a fun and useful application.
